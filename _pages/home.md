I am a second year CS PhD student at UT Austin, working with [Prof. Yuke Zhu](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~yukez/) and the [Robot Perception and Learning Lab](https://rpl.cs.utexas.edu). My research focuses on generalization and long-term memory in deep reinforcement learning. Before coming to Austin, I studied Math and CS at the University of Virginia, where my research was advised by [Prof. Yanjun Qi](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/yanjun/).
